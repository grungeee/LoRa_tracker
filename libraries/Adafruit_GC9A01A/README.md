Requires the Adafruit_GFX library for Arduino.

EXTRAS FOLDER: Adafruit_Arcada_FeatherM4.h file can be used with
Adafruit_Arcada library to make the M4_Eyes sketch compile on Adafruit
Feather M4 with this display (second display has not been tested,
would require setting up a second SPI SERCOM, but in theory it should work).
