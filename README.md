### Materials

- Arduino Uno
- Breadboard

- LoRa Module
- GPS Module (With GPS Antenna)
- __GY-9250__ (update the list!)
- 1.28" LCD
- 16Bit LED-Ring

- Power
    - Lipo
    - StepUp
    - StepDown

### Progress Functionality


- [x] LoRa Module
    - works on Arduino
    - works on esp32

- [x] GPS Module
    - worked like a charm both on arduino and esp32

- [x] 16Bit LEd-Ring
    - it works, the actual code is dependant on the GPS and GY        

- [ ] 1.28" LCD
    - could use it for troubleshooting atm, actual UX/UI is the last thing that needs to be done

- [ ] GY-9250
    - got some work done on GY-512
    - need to redo for compass
    - fuck none of the GYros I got have magnetometer working. WHY T_T

- [ ] Power
    - used a tiny USB-C charging board (USB/IN,BAT,OUT[5V])
    - need 18650 with lower current, 40A ain't charging
    - StepDown for ESP32!

- [ ] Enclosure
    - The one I made was a chaos. At least it holds the protoboard with components on it.
