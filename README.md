### Progress Functionality


- [/] LoRa Module
    - works on Arduino
    - code kinda works on esp32 but no communction is established
- [x] GPS Module
    - worked like a charm both on arduino and esp32
- [x] 16Bit LED-Ring
- [/] 1.28" LCD
    - Still got no usable implications
- [ ] GY-9250
    - got some work done on GY-512
    - need to redo for compass
- [ ] Power
    - didn't even start to work on a prototype.
    - i got charging slot for a 18650
    - 1x 18650 lying around 
    - maybe a StepUp or a StepDown
